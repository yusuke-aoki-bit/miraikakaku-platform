# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers.

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER** commit `.env` files to version control
- Use environment variable templates (`.env.template`) instead
- Store sensitive data in secure secret management systems
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Authentication
- Use strong, randomly generated JWT secret keys
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

### Database Security
- Use connection pooling with appropriate limits
- Implement proper SQL injection prevention
- Use parameterized queries
- Regular security audits of database access

### API Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling (don't expose internal details)
- CORS configuration
- Authentication and authorization for all endpoints
